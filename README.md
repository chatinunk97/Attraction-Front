# What does it do ?

- Fetch data from API and display the attractions with pagination.

- Mainly focused library is React Data Table Component

- Most of the type is still ANY => still have to figure out how TS can fit in with this library (the table)

- The Pagination and Sort are all in Remote
which mean the logic that does the pagination and Sort are done in the back end

(on the other hand if it's Local all data would be fetch to the browser first then filter out what we don't need)
